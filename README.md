# Amalgam
Amalgam is Amalgic if it took a fully fan-focused direction. Many of the new content straddles the lines of headcanon and falls into fanon for the sake of idealogical experimentation, surrealism, and gameplay benefit.

Because of its experimental and head-forward nature, Amalgam _may_ cause issues with pre-existing gameplay mechanics in vanilla Amalgic, and if done with an unsupported version, can lead to catastrophic consequences.

## Dependencies
Amalgam requires Amalgic 1.10.1, also called **X11p12** or **X11p13**, and Java SE 8, to operate.

## Additions
* Drain Lilies, spawned when bushes are drained.
* Steven and Connie, fuses into Stevonnie.
* Gem Shards, crafted from cracked gems, can possess items.
* Citrine, yellow Quartz with defective Ametrine counterpart.
* Ender Pearl, derpy Pearl that acts as warp pad.
* Pyrite, fire-breathing Ruby.

* Nephrite, shoots acid spit at dangerous mobs and blocks.
* Emerald, unfinished warrior gem, leads Nephrites.
* Aqua Aura Quartz, blue, shiny Quartz gem.

* Melanite, black gem created by SnappyDragon64 that hunts defectives and fusions and turns gems into shards.
* Bubbling, right click item with gem staff to bubble, right click bubble to send off.
* Mobile Injector Entities, built like golems.

## Changes
* Crux blocks for lightly modded games are enabled but no blocks exist at them moment.
* Pearls can't be grown from Kindergartens and require a **Mother of Pearl**.

## Fixes
